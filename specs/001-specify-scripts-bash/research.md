# Research: ASCII Art Converter CLI

## Language Choice

**Decision**: Python 3.11+

**Rationale**: 
- Excellent CLI framework ecosystem (click, argparse)
- Rich image processing libraries
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Good balance of performance and development speed
- Strong community support for ASCII art algorithms

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Rust: Better performance, but steeper learning curve and fewer high-level image processing libs
- Go: Simple and fast, but limited image processing options compared to Python

## Image Processing Library

**Decision**: Pillow (PIL fork)

**Rationale**:
- Most popular Python image processing library
- Supports all common formats (PNG, JPG, BMP)
- Easy grayscale conversion and pixel access
- Lightweight and well-maintained
- Good performance for typical image sizes

**Alternatives Considered**:
- OpenCV: More powerful but overkill for simple operations, heavier dependency
- ImageMagick bindings: Powerful but complex, external dependency

## ASCII Art Algorithm

**Decision**: Grayscale to character mapping with adjustable density

**Rationale**:
- Standard approach for ASCII art conversion
- Allows customization of character set and resolution
- Computationally simple but effective
- Can handle both images and text input

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Edge detection algorithms: More complex, may not suit simple ASCII art
- Dithering techniques: Better quality but slower, overkill for basic use case

## CLI Framework

**Decision**: Click library

**Rationale**:
- Intuitive command definition
- Built-in help generation
- Good error handling
- Widely used in Python CLI tools

**Alternatives Considered**:
- argparse: Standard library, but more verbose
- Typer: Modern alternative, but less mature than Click

## Testing Framework

**Decision**: pytest

**Rationale**:
- Industry standard for Python testing
- Rich assertion library
- Good fixture support
- Easy to integrate with CLI testing

**Alternatives Considered**:
- unittest: Standard library, but less convenient
- tox: For multi-environment testing, but overkill for single project

## Performance Considerations

**Research Findings**:
- Typical image sizes (under 10MB) process in <1s on modern hardware
- Memory usage scales with image size, but manageable under 100MB
- No concurrency needed for CLI tool
- CPU-bound operation, but fast enough for interactive use

**Recommendations**:
- Implement streaming for very large images if needed
- Add progress indication for long operations
- Consider caching for repeated conversions (though unlikely)
