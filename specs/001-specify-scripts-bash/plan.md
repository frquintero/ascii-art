# Implementation Plan: ASCII Art Converter CLI

**Branch**: `001-specify-scripts-bash` | **Date**: 2025-10-18 | **Spec**: spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-specify-scripts-bash/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Build a CLI tool that converts images and text to ASCII art with customizable characters and density. Technical approach: Use Python with image processing library for grayscale conversion and character mapping algorithm.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI
**Storage**: SQLite
**Testing**: pytest
**Target Platform**: Linux
**Project Type**: single
**Performance Goals**: This app is going to run locally online
**Constraints**: Memory usage under 100MB during processing
**Scale/Scope**: Single user CLI tool, no concurrency requirements

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Clear and Modern Coding**: Plan must specify use of modern language features and clear coding standards.
- **No Patching Solutions**: Ensure proposed solution addresses root causes, not temporary fixes.
- **Test-Driven Development**: Plan must include test strategy and TDD approach.
- **Code Review**: Define code review process and quality gates.
- **Documentation**: Plan must include documentation strategy for the feature.

├── converter.py    # Core ASCII art conversion algorithms
└── utils.py        # Helper functions for file I/O and validation

├── unit/           # Unit tests for individual functions
├── integration/    # Integration tests for full CLI workflows
└── fixtures/       # Test images and expected outputs
```

**Structure Decision**: Single CLI application structure chosen for simplicity. Core conversion logic separated from CLI interface for testability. Utilities handle common operations.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
