# Feature Specification: ASCII Art Converter CLI

**Feature Branch**: `001-specify-scripts-bash`  
**Created**: 2025-10-18  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "CLI that converts images or text into ASCII art, allowing for customization of characters and density."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Convert Image to ASCII Art (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to provide an image file and get ASCII art output so that I can display images in text-based environments.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that delivers the primary value of converting images to ASCII art.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the CLI with an image file and verifying ASCII art is produced that resembles the image.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid image file (e.g., PNG, JPG), **When** I run the CLI with the image path, **Then** it outputs ASCII art to stdout.
2. **Given** an invalid file, **When** I run the CLI, **Then** it displays an error message and exits with non-zero code.

### User Story 2 - Convert Text to ASCII Art (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to provide text input and get ASCII art representation so that I can create stylized text banners.

**Why this priority**: Provides additional input capability alongside images for comprehensive text-to-ASCII conversion.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by providing text string and verifying ASCII art text output.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a text string, **When** I run the CLI with text input, **Then** it outputs ASCII art version of the text.
2. **Given** empty text, **When** I run the CLI, **Then** it outputs empty or minimal output without error.

---

### User Story 3 - Customize Character Set (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to specify a custom set of characters for the ASCII art so that I can control the visual style and appearance.

**Why this priority**: Enhances customization without being essential for basic functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by providing custom character string and verifying output uses only those characters.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a custom character string, **When** I run the CLI with character option, **Then** output uses only characters from the provided set.
2. **Given** an empty character set, **When** I run the CLI, **Then** it uses a default character set.

---

### User Story 4 - Adjust Output Density (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to control the density/resolution of the ASCII art so that I can balance detail level with output size.

**Why this priority**: Fine-tuning feature for advanced users.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by specifying density value and verifying output dimensions match.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a density value, **When** I run the CLI with density option, **Then** output width matches the specified density.
2. **Given** invalid density value, **When** I run the CLI, **Then** it uses a default density and shows a warning.

### Edge Cases

- Invalid image file formats (e.g., corrupted files)
- Very large image files that might cause memory issues
- Empty or very long text inputs
- Non-existent file paths
- Special characters in text input

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST accept image file paths as command line arguments
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept text strings as command line arguments
- **FR-003**: System MUST output ASCII art to standard output
- **FR-004**: System MUST support custom character sets via command line options
- **FR-005**: System MUST support density adjustment via command line options
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle common image formats (PNG, JPG, BMP)
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide helpful error messages for invalid inputs

### Key Entities

- **Input Source**: Either a file path or text string, with optional configuration parameters
- **Configuration**: Character set string and density value
- **Output**: ASCII art string

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can convert images up to 10MB in size in under 30 seconds
- **SC-002**: ASCII art output preserves recognizable features of the original image (subjective but verifiable by visual inspection)
- **SC-003**: Output is properly formatted for terminal display without wrapping issues
- **SC-004**: Custom character sets are applied correctly, changing the visual appearance
- **SC-005**: Density adjustments produce expected output dimensions
